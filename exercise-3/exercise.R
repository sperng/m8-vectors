# Exercise 3: Vector and function practice

# Create a vector `marbles` with 6 different colors in it (representing marbles)
marbles <- c("green", "red", "orange", "yellow", "blue", "indigo")

# Use the `sample` function to select a single marble

marble <- sample(marbles, 1)
# Write a function MarbleGame that does the following:
# - Takes in a `guess` of a marble color
# - Randomly samples a marble
# - Returns whether or not the person guessed accurately (preferrably a full phrase)

MarbleGame <- function(a) {
  right.marble <- sample(marbles,1)
  if (right.marble == a) {
    return('You win')
  } else {
    return('You lose')
  }
}

# Play the marble game!

MarbleGame('green')

# Bonus: Play the marble game until you win, keeping track of how many tries you take

playUntilWin <- function(count, color) {
  count + 1
  guess <- MarbleGame(color)
  if (guess != 'You win') {
   return (playUntilWin(count, color))
  } else {
    return (count)
  }
}

playUntilWin(0, 'green')

## Double bonus(answer not provided): play the game 1000X (until you win) and track the average number of tries
# Is it what you expected based on the probability
